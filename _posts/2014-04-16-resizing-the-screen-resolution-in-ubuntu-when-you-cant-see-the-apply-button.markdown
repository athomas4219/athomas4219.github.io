On a normal day I spend most of my time in Windows 7 and Windows 8 doing my job and playing video games. I'm an Apple fanboy, so also have an old Mac (new ones are expensive!). However, I like to experiment with Linux just to see what's up.

I recently installed a beta release of Ubuntu 14.04 into VMware to see what's new. After installation, my resolution was stuck in 800x600, which makes for a very small screen. I went to the display settings panel, changed my resolution to something larger, and went to click the `Apply` button...which I couldn't see. No matter what I tried, I could not manage to drag the settings window around such that I could see the Apply button.

A little help from the internet ultimately showed that after clicking the resolution size text box you need **6 tabs**, then `Return` in order to click the `Apply` button.
