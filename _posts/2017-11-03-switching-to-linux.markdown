# Why

After years of using Linux, but not really committing to it, I've finally decided to turn to Linux as my main operating system for my day-to-day activities. For years I've used Windows because I was a PC gamer, but I left that behind when I moved to being a console gamer. Since then I've been a Mac user, but I've found myself increasingly drawn to Linux lately for reasons I can't explain. I guess Linux geeks are more my type than macOS or Windows geeks.

# What

I've always been more comfortable with Ubuntu flavors of Linux, but I wanted to give most of the major distributions a try. I've never had much success with the rolling distributions like [Arch Linux](https://www.archlinux.org/) so I didn't even consider them. I'll be sticking with the following:

* [Ubuntu](https://www.ubuntu.com/)
* [Fedora](https://getfedora.org/)
* [openSUSE](https://www.opensuse.org/)
* [PopOS!](https://system76.com/pop)

# How

I'm sort of just playing it by ear on choosing a distribution, but I do have a few things I'll be comparing:

* Breadth of packages - I'd prefer to just run a command with the package manager and get my software.
* Ease of management - I love the scriptability of Linux, but it's sometimes nice to have a GUI to manage things too.
* Support for my hardware - I'll be installing on a desktop and a MacBook Pro 13", which can sometimes be picky with Linux distributions.
* Works "out of the box" - while I'm not opposed to terminal work, I really don't want to have to figure things out, I'd prefer that they just work (file sharing, for example)
