# Why

After years of using Linux, but not really committing to it, I've finally decided to turn to Linux as my main operating system for my day-to-day activities. For years I've used Windows because I was a PC gamer, but I left that behind when I moved to being a console gamer. Since then I've been a Mac user, but I've found myself increasingly drawn to Linux lately for reasons I can't explain. I guess Linux geeks are more my type than macOS or Windows geeks.

# What

I've always been more comfortable with Ubuntu flavors of Linux, but I wanted to give most of the major distributions a try. I've never had much success with the rolling distributions like [Arch Linux](https://www.archlinux.org/) so I didn't even consider them. I'll be sticking with the following:

* [Ubuntu](https://www.ubuntu.com/)
* [Fedora](https://getfedora.org/)
* [openSUSE](https://www.opensuse.org/)
* [PopOS!](https://system76.com/pop)
* [Linux Mint](https://linuxmint.com/)

# How

I'm playing it by ear on choosing a distribution and I only have a couple of  things I'll be comparing:

* Support for my hardware - I'll be installing on an Acer Predator desktop and a MacBook Pro 13", which can sometimes be picky with Linux distributions.
* Works "out of the box" - while I'm not opposed to terminal work, I really don't want to have to figure things out, I'd prefer that they just work (file sharing, for example)

# Ubuntu

As I mentioned before, I am biased towards Ubuntu.

Pros:

* All the packages
*

# Fedora

# openSUSE

# PopOS!

# Linux Mint
