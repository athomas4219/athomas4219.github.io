Today I undocked my laptop from my docking station and headed to a meeting. When I arrived, I found that my Outlook had turned into a title bar, looking like this (no, the screenshot is not cut off, that's what it really looked like):

{% img /images/OutlookScreenshot.png 'Outlook Screenshot' 'Outlook Screenshot' %}

No matter what I tried, I could not get it back. No other application on my laptop behaved this way, just Outlook.

Ultimately, I found that Outlook could be restored simply by right-clicking on the task bar and selecting `Cascade Windows`.

Outlook is back!
